# HIPSTERFY

Have you ever wondered what song in your spotify playlists was the most underated? (probably not...)
But if you have and want some extra cool street cred at your local coffee shop whilst you twirl your finely groomed salvador dali mustache
then look no further!

Hipsterfy will do the hard work for you, when you run the application all you need to do is grant it access to make requests to spotify on your behalf.
(no account details are stored, after authenticating with oAuth the application is provided a limited access token for making requests)

you will be provided a view of all your playlists wherein all you need to do is click on the associated button to retrieve the least popular song in a given playlist.

### Starting the application
1. Clone the git repo
2. run **npm install** to install all dependencies
3. run **npm start** to launch the application
