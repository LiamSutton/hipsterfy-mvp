# HIPSTERFY

Have you ever wondered what song in your spotify playlists was the most underated? (probably not...)
But if you have and want some extra cool street cred at your local coffee shop whilst you twirl your finely groomed salvador dali mustache
then look no further!

Hipsterfy will do the hard work for you, when you run the application all you need to do is grant it access to make requests to spotify on your behalf.
(no account details are stored, after authenticating with oAuth the application is provided a limited access token for making requests)

you will be provided a view of all your playlists wherein all you need to do is click on the associated button to retrieve the least popular song in a given playlist.

### Starting the application
1. Clone the git repo
2. run **npm install** to install all dependencies
3. run **npm start** to launch the application

### Tools used ###
1. Spotify API
2. React
3. Ajax

### Retrospective ###
Is it perfect? absolutely not, this was hacked together over the space of a few days and was just an idea i had to try learn the spotify API and React.
I'm sure the implementation could be alot cleaner and it was only near the end of the project I used React-Strap, on mobile the sizing isnt perfect and a million other things.

One day I might refactor the application to fit best practices but at this moment it's a small kinda cool but uesless thing but none the less it's taught me some important lessons :)
